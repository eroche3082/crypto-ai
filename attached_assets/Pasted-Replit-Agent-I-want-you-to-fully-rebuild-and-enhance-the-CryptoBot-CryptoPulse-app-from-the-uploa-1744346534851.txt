Replit Agent, I want you to fully rebuild and enhance the CryptoBot (CryptoPulse) app from the uploaded file `CryptoPulse.zip`.

Please follow the same style, structure, and folder setup as in the ZIP. All core APIs and keys are already implemented, so just reuse them as needed.

The app should include the following features:

1. **Real-Time Cryptocurrency Dashboard**  
   - Display updated prices for BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, USDT, BNB, SOL, and others  
   - Include 24h/7d/1m filters, visual indicators (gain/loss), and dynamic updates  

2. **AI Chat Assistant (Gemini AI)**  
   - Powered by `gemini-1.5-pro`, default language in **Spanish**  
   - Should be able to explain market trends, DeFi, predict prices, answer crypto questions  
   - Includes pre-defined quick prompts like “BTC Price Prediction”, “What’s trending”, “Explain On-chain Analysis”, etc.

3. **Multi-language Support**  
   - Default: Spanish  
   - Add: English, Portuguese, French  

4. **Portfolio Simulator**  
   - Allow users to add, remove, and track simulated crypto investments  
   - Add portfolio analytics: ROI, risk indicators, and performance summaries  

5. **Alert System**  
   - Set customizable price alerts for individual cryptocurrencies  

6. **Crypto Converter**  
   - Convert between coins (e.g. BTC to USDT) with real-time values  

7. **Crypto News + Education Hub**  
   - Educational resources about blockchain, NFTs, DeFi  
   - News feed with most recent crypto-related articles  

8. **AR / QR / Camera Buttons**  
   - Activate interactive AR view and QR scanner interface  

9. **Firebase Integration**  
   - For login/auth and user session tracking  

10. **Stripe Integration** (optional for premium features or subscriptions)

11. **UI/UX**  
   - Keep current dark theme from the ZIP  
   - Responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile  

12. **Deployment-ready**  
   - Project must be ready to deploy on Firebase Hosting or another public frontend service  

> After setting everything up, run the app with `npm run dev` and notify me when the full preview is ready.

You do not need to ask for confirmation — just begin building and notify when the process is complete.
