FEATURE 1: CHART PATTERN RECOGNITION (Top Priority)
üîç MegaPrompt: Chart Pattern Recognition Module Implementation
Objective:
Enable CryptoBot to visually recognize chart patterns (e.g., head and shoulders, double tops, triangles) from user-uploaded images or in-browser chart captures, and provide predictive insights based on those patterns.

üß† Core Capabilities to Implement
Image Upload & Input Modalities

Allow users to:

Upload chart screenshots (PNG, JPG)

Paste URLs to charts

Capture snapshots directly from browser if possible (using HTML5 canvas or extensions)

Google Vision API Integration

Use Vision API to:

Preprocess the image: crop axes/text, normalize resolution

Run trained ML models for shape recognition

Label technical indicators and detect price trend lines

Use Vertex AI to:

Match detected shapes with known chart patterns

Output predicted pattern type + expected market movement

Technical Pattern Database

Maintain a local DB or JSON structure of:

Pattern names

Confidence intervals

Historical win rates

Typical entry/exit rules

Link this with learning path for educational explanation

Chat + Visual Output

Generate:

Chat summary: "This appears to be a bullish flag with 78% historical accuracy"

Visual overlay on chart showing entry, exit, SL zones

Table output: pattern info, accuracy, asset history, notes

Voice Accessibility (Optional)

Enable voice command trigger: ‚ÄúAnalyze this chart‚Äù

Output results via Text-to-Speech if enabled

Command Examples

/analyze chart BTC/USDT H1

/upload pattern-check

üîê Required APIs & Services
Google Vision API ‚Äì Image pattern labeling & shape detection

Vertex AI ‚Äì Pattern classification using custom models

Gemini (Vertex) or GPT-4o ‚Äì Summary generation & explanation

Chart Overlay Tool ‚Äì QuickChart or similar to annotate images
