MEGAPROMPT – FRONTEND + CHATBOT SYSTEM – CRYPTOAI
INSTRUCTIONS FOR CRYPTOAI AGENT TEAM
This prompt serves as the definitive guide to finalize the front-facing user experience and chatbot onboarding flow for CryptoAI. Do not make any frontend layout changes unless specifically instructed below.

SECTION 1: FRONTEND STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
KEEP EXISTING APPROVED DESIGN

The current frontend layout, typography, spacing, button positions, color scheme, and overall theme have been approved and must not be modified.

No auto-generated UI adjustments or replacements unless explicitly ordered.

ACTIVE LINKS VERIFICATION

All navbar buttons must be checked and confirmed to be functional:

Home

Features

Pricing

Testimonials

About

Get Started (should lead to login system)

Login (must open access to the pre-approved dashboard)

CHATBOT LOCATION

Only ONE chatbot icon should appear on the page, located at the bottom-right corner.

Remove any extra "Setup My Profile" or "Chat" elements on the page. All interactions must go through this icon.

REMOVE/REPLACE BUTTONS

Remove any secondary call-to-action buttons like "Create Profile" or “Setup Wizard” if not part of the chatbot.

The chatbot icon is the sole entry point for onboarding.

SECTION 2: CHATBOT ONBOARDING FLOW
INITIAL FLOW STRUCTURE

When the user clicks the chatbot icon:

Step 1: Ask “What’s your name?”

Step 2: Ask “What’s your email address?”

These values are saved into the lead database linked to the admin panel.
