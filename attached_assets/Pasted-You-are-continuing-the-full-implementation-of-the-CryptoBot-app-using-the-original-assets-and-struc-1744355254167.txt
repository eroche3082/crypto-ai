You are continuing the full implementation of the CryptoBot app, using the original assets and structure provided in the `CryptoPulse.zip` file.

The current version is missing critical pages and features that were present in the original design. Please follow these instructions:

---

### PHASE 1 – ROUTER FIXES

1. ✅ Add the following missing pages to the router:
   - `/favorites`
   - `/locations`
   - `/analysis`
   
Each route must point to its corresponding component from the original CryptoPulse.zip structure. If components are missing, recreate them based on the original layout and features.

---

### PHASE 2 – RESTORE UI/UX FROM ORIGINAL VERSION

2. ✅ Match the layout and interaction from the original CryptoPulse app:
   - Move the **Gemini AI chatbot** outside of the page layout.
     - Place a floating chat icon at the bottom-right.
     - On click, open a full-screen chat panel (overlay or slide-out).
     - This should mirror the original UX where chat does not cover content by default.
   - Restore the **CryptoNews page** as it appeared in the original version:
     - Show latest articles in card format with shimmer effect on load
     - Include search bar and popular keyword tags
     - Support categories like Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFT, Regulation, Blockchain
   - Match the **dark theme** and sidebar navigation icons exactly as shown in the original app.

---

### PHASE 3 – USE ZIP RESOURCES

3. ✅ Reuse all available components, pages, and styles from the `CryptoPulse.zip` archive.
   - Reconnect any context, styles, or shared components that were used in the original
   - Import animations, assets, layout wrappers, icons, or loading skeletons

---

### PHASE 4 – FIX AI CHATBOT

4. ✅ Fix the Gemini AI chatbot which is currently not responding:
   - Use the model `gemini-1.5-pro` or latest Gemini Flash via direct API
   - Confirm that chat sends and receives data correctly
   - Add language detection and dynamic switching (EN/ES)
   - Ensure AI uses crypto-focused prompts (trends, DeFi, predictions, market insights)

---

### PHASE 5 – FINAL TESTING

5. ✅ After all updates:
   - Restart the app
   - Test each route
   - Confirm chatbot opens from floating icon
   - Validate that all restored pages work and match original layout
   - Confirm that Gemini AI responds to: *"What is DeFi?"* and *"Give me a BTC prediction."*

DO NOT delete any components. Reuse existing ones where possible. Execute each task without asking for confirmation and show no logs unless there’s an error.
