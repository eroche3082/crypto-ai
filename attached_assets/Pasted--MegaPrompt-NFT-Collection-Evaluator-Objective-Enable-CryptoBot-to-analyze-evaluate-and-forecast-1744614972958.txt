 MegaPrompt: NFT Collection Evaluator
Objective:
Enable CryptoBot to analyze, evaluate, and forecast NFT collections using real-time marketplace data, AI-driven valuation models, and risk metrics—offering users actionable insights about NFT trends, rarity, liquidity, and future potential.

🧠 Core Capabilities to Implement
NFT Collection Query & Recognition

Allow user input:

/evaluate BAYC

/nft floor Azuki

“How’s CloneX performing?”

Detect and match collection name from major NFT platforms:

OpenSea, Blur, LooksRare, Magic Eden

Marketplace API Integrations

Use:

OpenSea API

Rarible API

Magic Eden (Solana)

Optional: Zora / Foundation / Blur for advanced users

Pull data:

Floor price, volume, supply, listings

Recent sales and average price

Rarity distribution

Holder concentration

AI-Driven Insights (Gemini/Vertex)

Interpret trends:

"Volume is up 24% in the last 7 days"

"Whale wallets increased holdings by 6%"

"High overlap with top metaverse collections"

Predict potential movement or valuation models:

“Estimated upside: +18% based on sales velocity”

“Listing-to-sale ratio suggests impending floor drop”

Risk/Volatility Scoring

Introduce “NFT Risk Meter”:

Score based on liquidity, volume, holder distribution, wash trading

Example: “Risk Level: ⚠️ Medium – Low liquidity + high whale concentration”

NFT Tracker Dashboard

Visual frontend showing:

Floor price trend chart

Volume/sales heatmaps

Whale activity table

Twitter/social sentiment summary

Educational Overlay

If user is unfamiliar:

“Would you like a breakdown of what makes a good NFT investment?”

Generate explainer using GPT-4o or Gemini Flash (“Rarity explained”, “What is floor price?”)
