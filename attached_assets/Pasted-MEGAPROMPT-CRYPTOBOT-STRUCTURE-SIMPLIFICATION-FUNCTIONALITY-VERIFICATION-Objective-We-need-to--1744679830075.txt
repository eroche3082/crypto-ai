MEGAPROMPT – CRYPTOBOT STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION & FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION

Objective: We need to simplify, verify, and optimize the entire structure of CryptoBot, especially the sidebar and dashboard system. The current interface contains too many separated tabs (over 20), many of which are redundant or broken. We require a streamlined, scalable architecture that ensures usability, clarity, and system stability.

PHASE 1 – STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION
1. Sidebar Reduction & Reorganization (Max 10 Tabs): Reorganize the current side panel to include a maximum of 8–10 tabs, grouping similar functionalities under unified parent categories.

Suggested Tab Structure:

Dashboard

Market Overview

Your Journey

Alerts

Favorites

Portfolio

Portfolio Simulator

Digital Assets

Subscription Plans

Trading Tools

Live Price Tracker

Chart Patterns

Risk Watchlist

NFT Center

NFT Explorer

NFT Evaluator

NFT Gallery (if active)

Analytics & Insights

AI Analysis

Twitter Analysis

Investment Advisor

News

Reports & Validation

System Report

System Validator

API Health

System Check

Diagnostics (Group into one page or modal)

Simulators

Tax Simulator

Gamification

Converter

Settings & Onboarding

Your Profile / Journey

Membership

Wallet Messaging

Locations

Admin (if user is Admin)

User Management

Logs

Access Control

PHASE 2 – FUNCTIONALITY TESTING
2. Functionality Checklist:

 All pages should allow vertical scrolling (no layout blocks).

 Clicking Dashboard should not redirect to the Homepage.

 All tabs should load correctly and not be broken or "sample-only."

 Any non-functional tab must be removed or moved to Dev Mode.

 Grouped sections (e.g. NFT Explorer + NFT Evaluator) should be merged or linked from a single entry point.

 "Subscription Plans" must only appear inside user journey or dashboard, not floating in the side panel.

 "System Report," "System Validator," and "System Diagnostics" must be unified under a single System Health tab, or removed if non-functional.

 Remove duplicate or misleading items from the UI.

PHASE 3 – UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS
3. Simplification & Consistency:

 Ensure the app is visually consistent across all tabs (fonts, margins, paddings, button styles).

 All sections should use dark mode styling if enabled.

 Maintain responsiveness across mobile, tablet, desktop.

 All links/buttons must have visual feedback and action confirmation.

 Side panel tabs must highlight current selection.

 All sections should load in the same viewport without exiting the app container.

PHASE 4 – DEPLOYMENT CHECKPOINT
4. Testing & Deployment Flow:

 Test user onboarding flow: Start Onboarding → Journey Creation → Dashboard

 Test membership tab redirection to pricing & confirmation page

 Test Wallet Messaging & Alerts to ensure message system is active

 Verify AI modules (AI Analysis, Investment Advisor, Twitter Analysis) are connected to Vertex AI or Gemini API

 Verify Contact Us, Learning Center, Terms, and Footer links are working or hidden if empty.

DELIVERABLE:

Any recommendations for additional merging or features

Note: CryptoBot must be deploy-ready with scalable structure, unified flow, and no sample tabs or broken routes.
