CRYPTOAI – MEGAPROMPT DE ACTIVACIÓN DEL CHATBOT (FASE 1)
[WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY ANY FRONTEND DESIGN OR STRUCTURE]
The CryptoAI frontend has been approved. Absolutely no changes to the layout, buttons, spacing, or positioning are allowed, unless explicitly authorized by a future deployment prompt.

1. CHATBOT POSITIONING AND BEHAVIOR (FRONTEND ONLY)
The chatbot must be anchored on the bottom-right corner of the homepage, visible on all screen sizes.

Must open in a floating chat window (not full-screen, not replacing the page).

Must not override the setup form or any other UI elements.

The chatbot is for onboarding only — it is not the same as the dashboard assistant.

2. CHATBOT FLOW – 10 STRUCTURED QUESTIONS (ONBOARDING QUIZ)
This flow begins as soon as the user clicks the chatbot button.

STEP 1: Basic Information
“Welcome to CryptoAI! What’s your name?”
→ Text input

“Great to meet you, [name]! What’s your email address?”
→ Text input
→ Must be stored in Firebase or backend for lead capture
→ Used to pre-generate user account and profile

3. SYSTEM RESPONSE & NEXT STEP

Action: Show button → Login to Dashboard
User must be redirected to /login or /dashboard.

4. POST-LOGIN EXPECTATION (NOT THIS PHASE, BUT MUST BE LINKED)
