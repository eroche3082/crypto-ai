FOOTER MEGAPROMPT – CryptoBot AI
Agent Instructions:

We are in final pre-deployment for CryptoBot AI. You are now required to conduct a complete audit and sanitization of the footer to ensure:

No broken or empty links

All items are functional and real

Visual consistency is maintained

1. SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS
 Only keep icons that are linked to active and real accounts.

Twitter, GitHub, Instagram, LinkedIn.

If any icon is linked to #, javascript:void(0), or is empty → Remove it immediately.

2. "Quick Links" COLUMN
Items to verify:

Features → Must link to a real and populated section

Pricing → Must take the user to the pricing page or scroll to the plan comparison

Testimonials → Must link to the client feedback/testimonial section

Dashboard → Only keep if user is already logged in or if route is active

If any of these links do not open anything valid → REMOVE or comment out

3. "Resources" COLUMN
Blog → REMOVE unless there is a working blog page with at least 1 post

Documentation → REMOVE if it leads nowhere or placeholder

Help Center → Only keep if it opens a support portal, contact form, or help articles

API → If API docs are NOT ready and hosted publicly, REMOVE

4. "Contact" COLUMN
support@cryptobot.ai → Only show if this inbox is functional

123 Blockchain Blvd, San Francisco, CA → Placeholder address. REMOVE unless real

+1 (555) 123-4567 → Placeholder number. REMOVE unless active and monitored

Capitana’s Orders: This section must only show information that is real and verified by the team.
If the address or number is fake or generic → DELETE.

5. LEGAL LINKS (BOTTOM BAR)
 Verify Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy are active links

 If the legal documents are not available, either comment out or replace with a “Coming Soon” modal

6. MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
 Confirm that the entire footer renders cleanly on mobile

 No overlapping, invisible links, or overflowing icons

7. FINAL CONFIRMATION REPORT
Submit a checklist with:

✅ Verified and functional links

❌ Links or items removed

⚠️ Suggestions for content to add later (e.g. blog, docs, API when ready)
