   - List which endpoints are live and which are missing or broken
   - Validate if all multimodal services are responding (QR, Audio STT, Camera Analysis)
   - Check if translations are applied consistently across all chat and interface elements

2. Create a table with:
   - ✅ Fully working modules

3. Review and list:
   - System prompts used
   - AI models connected
   - Fallback sequence (Vertex > OpenAI > Claude)
