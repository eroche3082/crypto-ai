You're now entering the final full-system verification and correction phase for the CryptoBot AI application. Please go through this checklist and correct any inconsistencies.

---

### ✅ PHASE 1: Language Unification

1. Set **English as the only default visible language** in the entire app.
   - All pages, UI labels, sidebar, chat messages, input placeholders, and buttons must be in English only.
   - Remove any Spanish text remaining in the UI, including:
     - "Configuración actual del AI"
     - "Idioma"
     - Any fallback text or hardcoded labels in Spanish

2. The **language switcher** must exist but default to English and only switch the app language if a user manually selects another language.

3. Chatbot must display all default messages in English:
   - Welcome: "Hello! I'm your CryptoBot assistant. I can help you with cryptocurrency insights, analysis, predictions, and more."
   - Button: "Clear chat"
   - Input Placeholder: "Ask about crypto, trends, prices, etc."

### ✅ PHASE 2: Navigation Consistency

4. Update the **main menu (sidebar)** to include the following in proper English, with correct routing:
   - Cryptocurrency Dashboard
   - Favorites
   - Portfolio Simulator
   - Crypto News
   - Alert System
   - Cryptocurrency Converter
   - **AI Analysis**
   - Education Hub
   - Locations
   - Language Settings

Ensure the labels are all in English and match the original app's UX. Icons must match the `lucide-react` or custom set as seen in the `CryptoPulse.zip`.

### ✅ PHASE 3: Gemini Context + API Integration

5. Validate that all API Keys are connected and functional:
   - CoinGecko via `/api/crypto/coins/markets`
   - Gemini via `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` or fallback to direct Google API
   - News API via `/api/news` (using `NEWS_API_KEY`)
   - Stripe keys and webhooks
   - Google credentials for Vertex AI are functional using `google-credentials-global.json`

6. Confirm that the `GeminiContext.tsx`:
   - Has no circular dependencies
   - Exposes `language` and `setLanguage`
   - Supports dynamic AI language response based on context, defaulting to **English**

---

### ✅ PHASE 4: Functional Check of All Pages

7. Load and verify these pages **without errors**:
   - `/dashboard`
   - `/favorites`
   - `/portfolio`
   - `/news`
   - `/alerts`
   - `/converter`
   - `/analysis`
   - `/education`
   - `/locations`

Each must display content and interact with its API if required.

### ✅ PHASE 5: Floating Chatbot Finalization

8. Make sure the **FloatingChatbot**:
   - Opens as a full-screen or slide-out overlay
   - Does NOT block or overlap content when minimized
   - Displays in English by default
   - Shows clean error handling for AI unavailability
   - Allows clearing chat history with a clear button

---

### ✅ PHASE 6: Final Restart and Feedback

9. Restart the server
10. Load the app and test:

- Sidebar labels are all in English ✅  
- Pages `/favorites`, `/analysis`, `/locations` are loading ✅  
- Chatbot opens from floating icon ✅  
- Gemini responds in English ✅  
- News and crypto data are retrieved correctly ✅

Once done, report:
→ Language unified  
→ Chatbot functional  
→ Navigation updated  
→ Pages validated  
→ APIs tested and working  
→ UI/UX clean

Do not ask for confirmation. Execute directly and optimize the system.
