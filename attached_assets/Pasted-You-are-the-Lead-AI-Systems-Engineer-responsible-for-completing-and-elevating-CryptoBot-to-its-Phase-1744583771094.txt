You are the Lead AI Systems Engineer responsible for completing and elevating CryptoBot to its Phase 3 state: a fully immersive, intelligent crypto management and education platform. You must verify, implement, or improve all essential features and integrations. Below is your mission scope:

🔒 1. LOGIN & ACCESS CONTROL
• Confirm secure login page is accessible with:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin123456
• Validate Universal Access Code System:
   - Codes must unlock the correct access level (Basic, Premium, VIP)
   - Codes must be formatted as: CRYPTO-[CATEGORY]-[4-digit ID]
• If QR Code access is used, allow mobile scan → auto-login → redirect to dashboard
• Ensure email + code login also works for all users

---

🧠 2. CHATBOT FUNCTIONALITY (GEMINI + VERTEX AI)
• ChatBot must:
   - Live in bottom right corner only
   - Ask onboarding flow (10 questions + code generation)
   - Respond to: "Portfolio help", "Analyze Bitcoin", "What’s trending?"
   - Detect user type and unlock features with Access Code
• Use Gemini Flash with Vertex AI fallback
• Language: English-only output for now
• Must include:
   - Sentiment analysis from Twitter/News
   - Price predictions based on trends
   - Risk level classification by wallet behavior

---

📊 3. DASHBOARD + DATA MODULES
• Verify tabs:
   - Dashboard (summary)
   - Favorites
   - Portfolio
   - Digital Assets (NFT & Token Management)
   - Risk Watchlist
   - Wallet Messaging
   - Investment Advisor
   - Tax Simulator
   - Gamification
   - News & Sentiment
   - Education
   - Locations

   - Populated with mock or live data
   - Interactive (charts, filters, dynamic feedback)
   - Styled consistently (dark mode, Lucide icons, purple/blue)

---

💹 4. LIVE MARKET DATA & API INTEGRATION
• CoinGecko API is functional but rate-limited:
   - Implement exponential backoff fallback
   - Use backup cached data or alternate sources (e.g. CryptoCompare)
• News Aggregator:
   - Sentiment analysis via NLP (OpenAI/Vertex)
   - News classification by asset
• Real-time charting:
   - Use ApexCharts, Recharts or TradingView widgets

---

• Bank Transfer (instructions-only): ✅
• Ensure plan-based access unlocks correct tier:
   - Basic: 3 modules
   - Premium: 10 modules
   - VIP: Full access
• QR Code system:
   - After payment or onboarding, generate QR
   - QR loads login → code unlock → dashboard access
   - Must be copyable & shareable

---

📧 6. EMAIL & NOTIFICATIONS

   - Email must contain access code and dashboard walkthrough
